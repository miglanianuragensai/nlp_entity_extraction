 PERSONAL PROFILE Ben joined VMWP in 2002 and became an Associate of the firm in 2009.  He holds master de-
grees in both Architecture and in City Planning from UC Berkeley. Prior to attending graduate 
school, Ben was an accomplished classical pianist, earning an undergraduate degree in Music. 
Currently, Ben specializes in rapid architectural diagramming and prototyping to provide clients 
with quick understandings of a site’s potential. Being both bicultural and bilingual (Chilean-

sional, Ben’s interests in the social landscape as well as the more technical and idiosyncratic 
aspects of wood construction have influenced his work.
