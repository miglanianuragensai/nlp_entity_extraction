 FIRM RESPONSIBILITIES Elitsa works closely with clients, consultants, engineers and city staff to ensure that 
projects meet the needs of the owner, the future residents, the city and the neighbors. 
  Currently Elitsa oversees projects from initial conception to completed construction. 
She is involved in schematic design, design development, as well as coordinating 
construction documents and construction phases. Elitsa is the project manager 
of Potrero Block X in San Fransisco, the first phase of Rebuild Potrero, currently 
completing Construction Documents. 
  Elitsa is also overseeing the construction phase of Rotary Plaza Apartments in South 
San Francisco (a complete renovation of 170 units) and Colorado Park Apartments 
in Palo Alto (a renovation of 7 buildings housing 60 residential units). Other project 
experience at VMWP includes Cottonwood Place in Fremont (98 unit senior affordable 
housing), and Warner Creek in  Novato (61 unit senior housing). 
  Joining VMWP in 2008 as an administrative assistant, Elitsa’s intelligence and hard 
work quickly advanced her role to interim business manager, architectural design 
assistant and ultimately led her to pursue a degree in architecture. While completing 
her architectural degree at UC Berkeley, she stayed on at VMWP as an architectural 
intern and is now an essential member of the VMWP staff. 
 PERSONAL PROFILE Elitsa has lived in San Francisco, the Peninsula, and the East Bay and loves exploring 
hiking trails with her dog Cooper. In her spare time, Elitsa volunteers at Habitat for 
Humanity, working at the construction site at Mt. Burdell Place in Novato, CA.
