 PERSONAL PROFILE Kushal  has always enjoyed exploring the inter-relationship of architecture and urban 
design. His professional experience, spanning over five years, ranges from planning 
new mixed-use neighborhoods in China to  designing an hospital as an adaptive 
re-use of a shopping mall in India. Adaptive re-use is his favorite project type as he

manner.
