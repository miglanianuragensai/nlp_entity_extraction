  Profile 
In addition to being a contemporary landscape photographer, Wayne is also an active new 
media artist and consultant with an emphasis on photo-based online community-driven 
projects. New media scholars consider his award-winning project entitled “the degradation of 
the/a black male” a landmark in online community–based works and a forerunner of the blog 
and social media spheres of today.  
Wayne is an articulate and engaging communicator, who has lectured and run workshops 
internationally on his photographic and new media practice. He weaves diverse experiences 
in image making, technology, online media and new media art worlds to unearth unique, 
insightful and highly relevant perspectives on the connections between people, culture and 
technology. 
Whether he is using a camera or a computer Wayne’s practice is always focused on making our 
invisible connections seen and experienced in new ways.
